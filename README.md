# TAMAGOTCHI-CAYULE
Malum Gelata
A TAMAGOTCHI USER STORY

Theme/Story Ideas:
The user’s pet will be a black slime which is oozing from a crack in the floor or wall. The pet will respond to how it’s treated and whether or not it’s needs are met. Mistreating your pet can have dire consequences, but then again, so can feeding it…

Minimum Viable Project:

The user will press start to begin the game.
The start page will display instructions to the player on “how to play”.
The player will be able to name their pet.
The user will see a screen that has a character which represents their pet.
The user will see status bars and buttons that correspond to actions.
The Pet will age or “Wither” as the player progresses, represented by an on screen counter. 
When maximum age is hit, the game ends.
The player will take actions which impact the status bars and result in win/loss of game. 
Inaction is still considered a player choice and therefore an action which results in win/loss of game.
When the gauge is depleted (or in some cases filled, such as Malfeasance) the game ends.



As A User:
1. As a user, I want to read the instructions on screen so that I know how to win/lose and then press start to begin.

2. As a user, I want to see the pet character on screen as well as not be totally lost by what I am seeing.

3. As a user I want to press buttons to complete actions that meet my pets needs.

4. As a user, I want to meet the requirements to win the game which I can visually follow using the on screen gauges as indicators of what my pet needs.

5. As a user, I want to see the gauges filling or depleting as the game progresses.

6. As a user, when I win or lose, I want to be greeted with an outcome.

7. As a user, I want the ability to restart the game if I would like, using a button.
